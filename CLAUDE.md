# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for AI Agents

> This file provides context for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) working on this codebase.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task Tracking Rules

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context, or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

**Quick reference:**
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd sync` - Sync with git (run at session end)

For full workflow details: `bd prime`

## Project Overview

> **Pluto is the "nginx for AI agents"** — a minimal, fast, self-hostable runtime that runs agents defined in a **transparent, portable format**, exposed through a standard API.

Pluto treats agents as durable artifacts: files you own that should outlast the runtime.
- **Transparent agent format** (human-readable, inspectable, versionable)
- **Stateless by default** (no hidden server-side state)
- **File-based state** when present (specs, memories, logs, config) — if Pluto disappears, take these and host elsewhere
